      <h1>Weird XMM shuffle? Memory Copy Optimization!</h1>
      <button onclick="location.href='/'" class="home-button">‚Üê Home</button>
      <p>During my recent "C coding and subsequent reversing" session I've been experimenting with memory allocations, utilizing standard C functions like <code>memcpy()</code> or WinApi's <code>RtlCopyMemory</code>.</p>
      <p>Binary was compiled as x64 in VS2022's Release mode. Below, you can see the optimization that was applied, instead of direct <code>memcpy()</code> call that I specified in the original code:</p>

      <p>Alright, let's go step by step to understand what is happening here!</p>
      <pre>
mov rax, rbx
lea r8, unk_14004080
mov r9d, 2
      </pre>
      <p>This is the initial setup for subsequent XMM-oriented operations. <code>unk_14004080</code> is a previously allocated buffer with <code>272 bytes</code> of data to be copied from. <code>rax</code> contains a pointer to the destination address. Address of source buffer is loaded into <code>r8</code> via <code>lea r8, unk_14004080</code>. Next, <code>2</code> is copied into lower <code>32-bits</code> of <code>r9</code> register to serve as a loop counter.</p>
      <p>After that, we enter the main loop of data copy via <code>xmm</code> registers, which are <code>128-bit</code> registers designed for floating point arithmetics and variety of other data types.</p>

      </div>
      <p>Initial <code>lea rax, [rax+80h]</code> loads a pointer to <code>rax+80h</code> into <code>rax</code>. It essentially works as a destination pointer to where the data is being copied to from previously seen <code>r8</code>, that holds a pointer to allocated buffer with data.</p>
      <p>Next, <code>movups xmm0, xmmword ptr [r8]</code> instruction loads <code>16 bytes (128 bits)</code> of unaligned data, pointed to in memory by <code>r8</code> via <code>movups</code> into <code>xmm0</code> register. The <code>xmm0</code> now holds the first chunk of data. Another set of instructions:</p>
      <pre>
movups xmmword ptr [rax-80h], xmm0
movups xmm1, xmmword ptr [r8+70h]
movups xmmword ptr [rax-70h], xmm1
...
      </pre>
      <p>is the main body of the loop. <code>xmm1</code> and <code>xmm0</code> are utilized to fetch for <code>16 bytes</code> of data from the allocated buffer's memory address that is being held in <code>r8</code> (decreasing it by <code>10h (16 bytes)</code> after each <code>movups</code> instruction) and copying them into memory pointed to by <code>rax</code> (also decreasing the relative address to <code>rax</code> by <code>10h</code> in each instruction).</p>
